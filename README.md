I made this project in a programming class.

This program creates smiley faces for the user to manipulate.
There are a handful of attributes to change, and a handful of ways to change them.

The main focus of this project is the use of action events (mouse, keyboard) and the use of MVC (model, view, control). 
Exception handling, responding to user input, arrays, loops, primitive data types, constants, and randomization, are also used.
